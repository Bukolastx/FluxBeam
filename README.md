# FluxBeam üåê

**Streaming Micropayments Across the Stacks Continuum**

FluxBeam enables real-time, per-second micropayments using smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. Perfect for time-based access to APIs, streaming content, and remote work billing.

## Features

- **Real-time Micropayments**: Pay per second of service usage
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Automated payment release and refunds
- **Service Registration**: Providers can register services with custom rates
- **Balance Management**: Deposit, withdraw, and track usage in real-time
- **Session Control**: Start/stop sessions with automatic cost calculation
- **Secure Payments**: Built on Stacks blockchain with Bitcoin security

## How It Works

1. **Service Providers** register their services with per-second rates
2. **Users** deposit STX tokens into their FluxBeam balance
3. **Sessions** are started with estimated duration and automatic escrow
4. **Real-time billing** calculates exact usage upon session end
5. **Automatic settlement** pays providers and refunds excess to users

## Smart Contract Functions

- `deposit-funds(amount)` - Add STX to your FluxBeam balance
- `start-session(service-id, estimated-duration)` - Begin a metered session
- `end-session(session-id)` - Stop session and calculate final payment
- `withdraw-balance(amount)` - Withdraw unused STX from balance
- `update-service-status(service-id, status)` - Enable/disable services
